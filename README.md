👋 Hello! I’m a Research Assistant at WAMC, Cranfield University, focusing on thermo-mechanical FEM modelling of metal additive manufacturing i.e. metal 3-D printing.

When I’m not simulating, I geek out over Linux, photography, retro gaming, and open‑source scientific software. I also curate non‑fiction reading lists and listen to metal, ambient, and experimental electronic music.

Always glad to network with researchers, engineers, or hobbyists working at the intersection of science and computation.
